The solution lies in using the `isset()` function to check for the existence of an array key and explicitly handling cases where an element's value might be 0:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

if (isset($myArray[0])) {
    echo $myArray[0];
} else {
    echo "Index 0 is not set";
}

//Example using isset() and handling 0 values:
$myArray = [0 => '0'];

if (isset($myArray[0]) && $myArray[0] !== '0') {
    echo "Element Exists and is not 0";
} else {
    echo "Element is either not set or has a value of 0";
}
```

This revised code explicitly checks if the key exists before attempting to access its value, preventing errors related to accessing undefined indices.  The second example demonstrates explicitly checking for a value of '0' in addition to the existence of the index.
