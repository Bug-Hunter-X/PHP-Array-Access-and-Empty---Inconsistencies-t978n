In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this example:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["key1"] = "value1";
$myArray[1] = "value2";

echo $myArray[0]; // Notice the attempt to access an undefined index
```

This code will output nothing (or a notice depending on your PHP error settings), because `$myArray[0]` is not set.  PHP's loose typing allows you to seemingly create an array element without explicitly defining the index, but internally the indices remain numerically consecutive, and gaps create unexpected behavior. Attempting to access `$myArray[0]` implicitly tries to access a non-existent element.

Another less common, but equally pernicious error is caused by inconsistent use of `isset()` and `empty()` checks. Consider this example:

```php
$myArray = [0 => 'value'];

if (!empty($myArray[0])) {
    echo "Element Exists";
} else {
    echo "Element Does Not Exist";
}
```

This will output "Element Does Not Exist".  `empty()` considers '0' (string or integer) as empty, thus returning true and entering the `else` block. Similarly,  `isset()` only checks for the existence of a key, not its value. Using the wrong function for validation leads to unexpected behaviors and logic errors.
